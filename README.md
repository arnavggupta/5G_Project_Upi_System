## 🚀 Features

### ⚡ Instant Transaction Updates
- Real-time balance and transaction history updates using **WebSocket**.
- No need to refresh the page — all updates are pushed live to the UI.

### 🔄 Redis Pub/Sub for Real-Time Communication
- Redis handles **publish/subscribe** functionality across servers.
- Ensures data consistency and lightning-fast updates across the system.

### 💰 Core Wallet Functions
- **Deposits**: Fund your wallet from linked bank accounts.
- **Withdrawals**: Move money back to your bank account.
- **Transfers**: Instantly send money to other users within the platform.

### 🔒 Transaction Integrity with PostgreSQL
- All transactions are **atomic** — either fully succeed or fully rollback.
- Built on **ACID-compliant PostgreSQL**, ensuring consistency and security.

### 🌐 Webhook Integration for Bank Confirmations
- Dedicated webhook server listens for external bank confirmations.
- Wallet balances update automatically upon receiving confirmation.

### 🔗 Smooth External Bank Integration
- Asynchronous handling prevents app delays during bank interactions.
- Resilient to slow or delayed bank response times.

### 📦 Scalable Infrastructure with Docker
- Fully containerized using **Docker** for effortless deployment.
- Easily scales across environments without performance drops.
